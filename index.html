<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for dropping by.<br> <br>
I am a fourth year undergrad at UC Berkeley, majoring in Computer Science (Honors Program) and Data Science. You can find my coursework <a href="https://huanzhimao.github.io/coursework">here</a>. 
In my academic pursuits, I have been fortunate to explore a wide range of domains in computer science. 
I have tried research in computer vision, autonomous driving, and adversarial machine learning before I found my strong passion in computer systems.
I'm interested in ML agents, human-computer interaction, security, distributed systems, and cloud computing.

I'm currently working on the <a href="https://gorilla.cs.berkeley.edu/">Gorilla LLM</a> project in the <a href="https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu/">Sky Computing Lab</a>, under Prof. Joseph Gonzalez and Prof. Ion Stoica, and Ph.D. student Shishir Patil and Tianjun Zhang.
I'm the co-first author of the <a href="https://gorilla.cs.berkeley.edu/leaderboard.html">Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL)</a> and the <a href="https://huggingface.co/gorilla-llm/gorilla-openfunctions-v2">Gorilla OpenFunction-v2</a>. Check out our <a href="https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla">repo</a>!
<br> <br>

A significant part of my educational journey has been my love for teaching and pedagogical theories. I'm currently the Head TA (Content) for CS 61A, <i>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</i>; I have been on course staff for 6 semesters. It is absolutely an amazing experience to help students learn and grow; love it. I have also been on course staff for Data 100, <i>Principles and Techniques of Data Science</i>, for 2 semesters.<br> <br>

Outside the sphere of academia, I have been involved in the fast-paced SaaS startups. As a former founding software engineer for Markit.AI, I had the privilege of working on image saliency detection for pre-launch analytics as part of the Skydeck Pad-13 Program.<br> <br>

Also, I love sailing, hiking, playing board games, and embarking on all kinds of outdoor adventures. I got national champion in the CYA (Chinese Yachting Association) Youth Sailing League in 2017. <br> <br>
