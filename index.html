<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for dropping by.<br><br>

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu/">Sky Computing Lab</a> at UC Berkeley, advised by Professors Joseph Gonzalez and Ion Stoica. My current research focuses on LLM agents, especially their tool-use abilities.<br><br>

I lead the <a href="https://gorilla.cs.berkeley.edu/leaderboard.html">Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL)</a> project, which has become the de facto benchmark for function calling. Check out our blog posts (<a href="https://gorilla.cs.berkeley.edu/blogs/8_berkeley_function_calling_leaderboard.html">BFCL v1</a>, <a href="https://gorilla.cs.berkeley.edu/blogs/12_bfcl_v2_live.html">BFCL v2</a>, <a href="https://gorilla.cs.berkeley.edu/blogs/13_bfcl_v3_multi_turn.html">BFCL v3</a>) and explore the <a href="https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla">codebase</a>â€”it has already earned 12 k+ stars!<br><br>

Prior to my Ph.D., I completed my undergraduate studies at UC Berkeley, majoring in Computer Science (Honors Program) and Data Science. You can find my coursework <a href="https://huanzhimao.github.io/coursework">here</a>. I have been fortunate to explore a wide range of domains in computer science and conducted research in computer vision, autonomous driving, and adversarial machine learning before discovering my passion for machine-learning systems.<br><br>

Teaching is another cornerstone of my educational journey. I served as the Head TA (Content & Infrastructure) for CS 61A, <i>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</i>, for seven semestersâ€”an absolutely amazing experience that let me help students learn and grow. I was also on the course staff for Data 100, <i>Principles and Techniques of Data Science</i>, for two semesters.<br><br>

Outside academia, I have worked in fast-paced SaaS start-ups. As a founding software engineer at Markit.AI, I developed image-saliency detection tools for pre-launch analytics as part of the SkyDeck Pad-13 Program.<br><br>

Beyond work, I enjoy sailing, hiking, playing board games, and all sorts of outdoor adventures. I was the national champion in the Chinese Yachting Association Youth Sailing League in 2017.<br><br>

If you share any of these interests or simply want to chat, donâ€™t hesitate to connectâ€”my calendar is always up to date! :D
