<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for dropping by.<br> <br>
I am a third year undergrad at UC Berkeley, majoring in Computer Science (Honors Program) and Data Science. You can find my coursework <a href="https://huanzhimao.github.io/coursework">here</a>. 
In my academic pursuits, I have been fortunate to explore a wide range of domains in computer science. 
I have tried research in computer vision, autonomous driving, and adversarial machine learning before I found my strong passion in computer systems.
My current research interest lies in the intersection of distributed systems, cloud computing, human-computer interaction, and security.
<br> <br>

A significant part of my educational journey has been my love for teaching and pedagogical theories. I'm currently a TA for CS 61A, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs; I have been on course staff for 4 semesters. It is absolutely an amazing experience to help students learn and grow; love it. I have also been on course staff for Data 100, Principles and Techniques of Data Science, for 2 semesters.<br> <br>

Outside the sphere of academia, I have been involved in the fast-paced SaaS startups. As a former founding software engineer for Markit.AI, I had the privilege of working on image saliency detection for pre-launch analytics as part of the Skydeck Pad-13 Program.<br> <br>

Also, I love sailing, hiking, playing board games, and embarking on all kinds of outdoor adventures. I got national champion in the CYA (Chinese Yachting Association) Youth Sailing League in 2017. <br> <br>
